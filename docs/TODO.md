  + I'm using `qDebug` for informational logging. Works but shit when you actually need to use `qDebug()` for debug.
  + "default:" and some other devices make QAudioRecorder freeze up indefineitely. Added lot of code to try and avoid but still happens!!
  + Add tail out time options to UI.
  + Add dpkg build notes or script.
